## About my app 
Here is an app that is a lifesaver for any meeting with friends! 🥳 If you don't have an idea for entertaining at the table, don't know what appetizers to serve or what original drinks to serve your guests PartyLifebelt is here to help! 🙌🏼 The application contains 4 games inspired by titles that everyone knows, at which it is impossible to get bored. In addition, it contains more than 400 recipes for drinks, which can be searched for by a specific ingredient, choose the one you are interested in from the list or for those who are undecided you can pick a random drink - so everyone will find something for themselves! Also a valuable lifeline is the section of recipes for food that will knock your friends out with originality and taste! 😁

But how it looks like? 👀

First our eyes will be shown a specially prepared launchscreen: 
<div id="header" align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121167654/220068098-7894248d-b035-45f0-aaa6-077d777dc862.png" width="200" height="400"/></div>

Then we will see the main screen of the application on which we can choose from three options: GAMES, DRINKS, FOOD:

After selecting the GAMES tab, we are taken to the game selection view. Each game includes a brief description of the rules under the logo. Selecting one of the four games, we proceed to the gameplay and have a great time! 😄

Another section is the DRINKS section, where we can search for a drink recipe by the ingredient we are interested in, by name or select it from a list. In addition, we can filter drinks into alcoholic and non-alcoholic using the segment at the bottom of the screen. But that's not all! For the very indecisive, there is a RANDOM button that will draw a drink recipe for us from the database. After selecting a specific item, we go to the details about our drink, i.e. information such as the title of the drink, the serving suggestion according to the photo, whether the drink contains alcohol, the necessary ingredients and the recipe.

</div>

The last section available is FOOD....
